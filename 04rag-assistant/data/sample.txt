## Zombie Types
If the world has gone crunchy, you need to identify what is shambling toward you before you decide whether to run, hide, or dramatically vault over a fence. Walkers are the classic slow undead: poor coordination, strong bite force, and a habit of gathering in crowds. Runners are recently turned hosts with speed, aggression, and enough muscle memory to open basic doors. Screamers are rare but dangerous: their piercing shriek attracts every nearby threat, including other survivors with bad intentions. Brutes are heavily built zombies, usually former athletes or laborers, and they can smash weak barricades in seconds. Observe movement patterns from a safe distance, never assume a lone zombie is truly alone, and remember that noise changes everything. Correct identification saves ammo, saves energy, and most importantly saves your team from heroic-but-short careers.

## Weapons & Gear
Your ideal loadout balances reliability, noise control, and stamina. A sturdy crowbar is excellent for prying, striking, and surviving rough weather; it is quiet and nearly unbreakable, but close range means higher risk. Hatchets are compact and effective for controlled strikes, though they can get stuck if used carelessly. A spear or polearm gives you precious distance in narrow corridors, but it is awkward indoors and slow in tight turns. Firearms should be treated as emergency tools: pistols are portable but require accuracy, while shotguns are devastating at close range but loud enough to invite every zombie within several blocks. Gear matters as much as weapons: gloves prevent hand injuries, eye protection blocks blood spray, and ankle-support boots reduce sprains during sprint escapes. Carry fewer items well rather than many items badly.

## Shelter Guidelines
The best shelter is boring, hard to notice, and easy to defend. Choose a structure with limited entrances, good visibility, and at least two escape routes. High ground helps, but only if access points can be controlled. Avoid glass-heavy buildings, basement-only hideouts, and places near hospitals, malls, or major highways where crowds once gathered. Fortify doors with cross-bracing, reinforce windows from the inside, and create a layered defense: early warning, outer barrier, inner fallback. Keep one room strictly for sleep and another for storage and medical work to reduce contamination risk. Light discipline is crucial at night, so use covered lamps and blackout curtains. Map nearby water sources and backup shelters before you settle in. A shelter is not a castle forever; it is a temporary advantage you must maintain every day.

## Food & Water
In a long survival scenario, clean water outranks almost every other resource. Collect water from rain systems, hot water tanks, and sealed commercial containers first; open rivers and ponds are last-resort sources. Purify by boiling for at least one full minute, filtering through a proper field filter, or using purification tablets exactly as directed. Store purified water in labeled, clean containers and rotate stock regularly. For food, prioritize non-perishables with high calories and useful nutrients: canned beans, fish, oats, rice, nut butter, dried fruit, and electrolyte powders. Build meal plans around energy needs rather than taste nostalgia, but include morale foods when possible because team psychology matters. Practice strict ration tracking with daily logs and reserve emergency packs for evacuation only. Never eat dented bulging cans, and never test questionable food "just to see."

## First Aid
Most survivor injuries are mundane but dangerous: cuts, sprains, burns, and dehydration can disable people faster than zombies. Every team should carry trauma shears, sterile dressings, elastic wraps, antiseptic, pain control, and oral rehydration salts. Clean wounds aggressively, apply pressure to stop bleeding, and monitor for infection signs such as heat, swelling, and fever. For fractures, immobilize before moving and avoid "walking it off." Heatstroke requires shade, cooling, and fluids; hypothermia requires dry clothing and slow warming. If someone is bitten, act immediately: isolate the patient, document time and location of the bite, clean and bandage the area, and assign an observer. Team policy on bites must be decided in advance, not during panic. Compassion and safety are both essential, but indecision is how entire groups collapse.

## Team Roles
A good team functions like a tiny expedition unit with clear roles and backup coverage. The Scout handles route planning, perimeter checks, and silent movement techniques. The Medic manages injuries, hygiene standards, and health logs for each member. The Engineer fortifies shelters, repairs gear, and improvises tools from scrap materials. The Quartermaster tracks food, water, batteries, fuel, and expiration dates so supplies do not vanish mysteriously. A Negotiator handles contact with outsiders and de-escalates conflict before it becomes violence. Finally, a Coordinator keeps schedules, rotates watches, and makes sure no one burns out from constant stress. Every member should cross-train in at least one secondary role in case of illness or loss. Teamwork beats solo heroics: the apocalypse rewards preparation, discipline, and people who can cooperate even when everyone is tired and scared.
